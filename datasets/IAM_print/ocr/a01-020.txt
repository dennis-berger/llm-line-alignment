MR. MACLEOD WENT ON WITH THE CONFERENCE AT LANCASTER HOUSE DESPITE THE CRISIS
WHICH HAD BLOWN UP. HE HAS NOW REVELED HIS FULL PLANS TO THE AFRICANS AND LIBERALS
ARTENDING. THESE PLANS DO NOT GIVE THE AFRICANS THE OVERAL MAJORITY THEY ARE SEEKING.
AFRICAN DELES ARE STUDING THEM TODAY. THE CONFERANCE WILL MEET TO DISCUSS THE
FUNCTION OF A PROPOSED HOUSE OF CHIEFS.
