MR. MADEOD WENT ON WITH THE CONFERENCE AT DAMASTER HOUSE DESPITE THE CRISIS
WHICH HAD BLOWN UP. HE HAS NOW REVELED HIS FULL PLANS TO THE ATRICANS AND LIBERALS
ATTENDING. THESE PLANS DO NOT GIVE THE AFRICANS THE OVERAL MAJORITY THEY ARE SEEKING.
AFRIAN DELERATES ARE STUDYING THEM TODAY. THE CONFERENCE WILL MEET TO DISCUSS THE
FUNCTION OF A PROPOSED HOUSE OF CHIEFS.
